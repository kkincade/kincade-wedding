                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                    <h3 class="subtitle underline">FROM KAMERON</h3>
                    <p class="section-description">My one word of advice to single men out there - learn to play the guitar. It gets all the ladies. In my case, it helped me land the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. My guitar was with me the day I met Mackenzie and on the day I asked her to be my wife (<a href="https://vimeo.com/135523505" target="_blank">proposal video</a>).</p>

                    <p class="section-description">At the start, the universe seemed against us. Date #1: A dinner date in Old Town Fort Collins. My car gets towed and I show a great amount of restraint paying $325 and not losing my cool in front of Mackenzie. Date #2: A Rockies game that was rained out in the 7th inning. Date #3: A Dave Matthews Band concert. Mackenzie passes out and is taken to the EMT tent (I was able to recite her address and birthday at this point in time...creepy or romantic?).</p>

                    <p class="section-description">But it's moments like these that remind me why I love this girl so much. They remind me that no matter what the world throws at us, she'll be by my side. Not only is she smart and beautiful, she's genuine. She opens my eyes to new perspectives. She is spontaneous yet easy going. She's an introvert like myself and enjoys sitting and watching a movie together. And she gives me free haircuts!</p>

                    <p class="section-description">I'm excited to finally share my life completely with this woman. I'm ready to buy a house, have a yard with a big dog, and eventually fill the place with little Kameron's and Mackenzie's!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                    <h3 class="subtitle underline">FROM MACKENZIE</h3>
                    <p class="section-description">Every girl dreams of love at first sight. A fairy tail ending, a knight in shining armor...or in my case, a handsome musician! It wasn't "love at first sight" necessarily, but after our first date I knew I was going to marry this guy. He is my better half in every way, and I'm certain God made us for each other.</p>

                    <p class="section-description">Our first few dates were anything but smooth, and going to Florida for a semester only a month after meeting didn't make it any easier. I'm glad we can both laugh off the mishaps, because through it all I've only grown to love him more. Since our first date, I've never once doubted that I would spend my life loving Kameron. He grounds me when I'm irrational and is my security when I'm overwhelmed. I could have never asked for someone so perfect for me.</p>

                    <p class="section-description">Kameron is the hardest worker I've ever met. I love how he is constantly pushing himself to new levels in every area of life. He's compassionate in ways I could never be, and too smart for his own good sometimes. I fell in love with his musician side, but it was definitely his humor that locked me in. It doesn't hurt that he's somewhat of a genius.</p>

                    <p class="section-description">I can't wait to conquer life with this man. We are each other's biggest fan, best friend, and other half. He's my favorite!</p>
